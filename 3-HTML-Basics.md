# HTML Basics

HTML is the markup language we use to structure content that we consume on the Web.

HTML is served to the browser in different ways. 
* It can be generated by a server-side application that builds it depending on the request or the session data, for example a Rails or Laravel or Django application. 
* It can be generated by a JavaScript client-side application that generates HTML on the fly. 
* In the simplest case, it can be stored in a file and served to the browser by a Web server.

Let's dive into this last case. Although in practice it's probably the least popular way to generate HTML, it's still essential to know the basic building blocks.

By convention, an HTML file is saved with a `.html` or `.htm` extension.

Inside this file, we organize the content using **tags**.

Tags wrap the content, and each tag gives a special meaning to the text it wraps.

Let's make a few examples.

This HTML snippet creates a paragraph using the `p` tag:

```html
<p>A paragraph of text</p>
```

This HTML snippet creates a list of items using the `ul` tag, which means *unordered list*, and the `li` tags, which mean *list item*:

```html
<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ul>
```

When an HTML page is served by the browser, the tags are interpreted, and the browser renders the elements according to the rules that define their visual appearance.

Some of those rules are built-in, such as how a list renders or how a link is underlined in blue.

Some other rules are set by you with CSS.

HTML is not presentational. It's not concerned with how things *look*. Instead, it's concerned with what things *mean*.

It's up to the browser to determine how things look, with the directives defined by who builds the page, with the CSS language.

Now, those two examples I made are HTML snippets taken outside of a page context.

### HTML page structure

Let's make an example of a proper HTML page.

Things start with the Document Type Declaration (aka _doctype_), a way to tell the browser this is an HTML page, and which version of HTML we are using.

Modern HTML uses this doctype:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

Then we have the `html` element, which has an opening and closing tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
...
</html>
```

Most tags come in pairs with an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag is written the same as the opening tag, but with a `/`:

```html
<sometag>some content</sometag>
```
There are a few self-closing tags, which means they don't need a separate closing tag as they don't contain anything _in them_.

The `html` starting tag is used at the beginning of the document, right after the document type declaration.

The `html` ending tag is the last thing present in an HTML document.

Inside the `html` element we have 2 elements: `head` and `body`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
	...
	</head>
	<body>
	...
	</body>
</html>
```

Inside `head` we will have tags that are essential to creating a web page, like the title, the metadata, and internal or external CSS and JavaScript. Mostly things that do not directly appear on the page, but only help the browser (or bots like the Google search bot) display it properly.

Inside `body` we will have the content of the page. The **visible stuff**.

### Tags vs elements

I mentioned tags and elements. What's the difference?

Elements have a starting tag and a closing tag. In this example, we use the `p` starting and closing tags to create a `p` element:

```html
<p>A paragraph of text</p>
```

So, an element constitutes the whole _package_:

- starting tag
- text content (and possibly other elements)
- closing tag

If an element has doesn't have a closing tag, it is only written with the starting tag, and it cannot contain any text content.

That said, I might use the tag or element term in the book meaning the same thing, except if I explicitly mention starting tag or ending tag.

### Attributes

The starting tag of an element can have special snippets of information we can attach, called **attributes**.

Attributes have the `key="value"` syntax:

```html
<p class="a-class">A paragraph of text</p>
```

> You can also use single quotes, but using double quotes in HTML is a nice convention.

We can have many of them:

```html
<p class="a-class" id="an-id">A paragraph of text</p>
```

and some attributes are boolean, meaning you only need the key:

```html
<script defer src="file.js"></script>
```

The `class` and `id` attributes are two of the most common you will find used.

They have a special meaning, and they are useful both in CSS and JavaScript.

The difference between the two is that an `id` is unique in the context of a web page; it cannot be duplicated.

Classes, on the other hand, can appear multiple times on multiple elements.

Plus, an `id` is just one value. `class` can hold multiple values, separated by a space:

```html
<p class="a-class another-class">A paragraph of text</p>
```

It's common to use the dash `-` to separate words in a class value, but it's just a convention.

Those are just two of the possible attributes you can have. Some attributes are only used for one tag. They are highly specialized.

Other attributes can be used in a more general way. You just saw `id` and `class`, but we have other ones too, like `style` which can be used to insert inline CSS rules on an element.

### Case insensitive

HTML is case insensitive. Tags can be written in all caps, or lowercase. In the early days, caps were the norm. Today lowercase is the norm. It is a convention.

You usually write like this:

```html
<p>A paragraph of text</p>
```

not like this:

```html
<P>A paragraph of text</P>
```

### White space

Pretty important. In HTML, white space is not relevant. Space is removed from the equation.

To the browser,

```html
<p>A paragraph of text</p>
```

is the same as

```html
<p>        A paragraph of text</p>
```

and the same as

```html
<p>A paragraph

of
           text          </p>
```

 
I'd say use the syntax that makes things visually more organized and easier to read, but you can use any syntax you like.

I typically favor

```html
<p>A paragraph of text</p>
```

or

```html
<p>
	A paragraph of text
</p>
```

Nested tags should be indented with 2 or 4 characters, depending on your preference:

```html
<body>
	<p>
		A paragraph of text
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A list item</li>
	</ul>
</body>
```

> Note: this "white space is not relevant" feature means that if you want to add additional space, it can make you pretty mad. I suggest you use CSS to make more space when needed.

> Note: in special cases, you can use the `&nbsp;` HTML entity (an acronym that means _non-breaking space_) - more on HTML entities later on. I think this should not be abused. CSS is always preferred to alter the visual presentation.
